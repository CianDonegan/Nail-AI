is this good
ChatGPT said:

Your CV is looking strong, especially for an entry-level AI/ML engineer role. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what‚Äôs working well and a few suggestions to make it even better:
‚úÖ What‚Äôs Good

    Clear Role Focus: Right off the bat, it states you're focused on AI/ML ‚Äî this is great for recruiters skimming CVs.

    Impact-Oriented Work Experience: The Stryker internship is well-written, showing real outcomes (e.g. ‚Äúaccelerated simulation setup by 100%‚Äù, ‚Äúsaved 5+ hours weekly‚Äù).

    Technical Stack: You mention relevant tools and frameworks clearly (TensorFlow, Docker, Azure DevOps, etc.).

    Project Details: Your final year project description shows not only technical skills but also analytical thinking (e.g., dataset inconsistencies, interpretability techniques).

    Education Timeline: You're clear about your graduation dates and progression from Level 7 to Level 8 ‚Äî great for showing upward momentum.

    LinkedIn Included: Always good to see this ‚Äî make sure it‚Äôs updated and aligns with your CV.

‚úèÔ∏è Suggestions for Improvement

    Format & Visuals:

        Consider using a modern CV template ‚Äî subtle design can make it more eye-catching.

        Section headers like "RELEVANT PROJECTS" and "WORK EXPERIENCE" are floating awkwardly ‚Äî consider reorganizing or using consistent formatting.

    Add a Technical Skills Section Up Top:

        Place a ‚ÄúTechnical Skills‚Äù section at the top or near your Career Summary, listing tools, frameworks, and languages grouped by type (e.g., Languages: Python, SQL | ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras | etc.).

        Right now, they‚Äôre scattered ‚Äî a recruiter scanning quickly might miss them.

    Quantify Your ML Project a Bit More:

        Add model accuracy / metrics if possible (e.g., ‚Äúachieved 87% validation accuracy‚Äù).

        Mention dataset size/type (e.g., ‚ÄúUsed 3,000 T1-weighted MRI images from XYZ dataset‚Äù).

    Tailor Career Summary Slightly More:

        A line like ‚ÄúSeeking an entry-level AI/ML role where I can apply skills in model development and data analysis‚Ä¶‚Äù would clarify your goals and improve targeting.

    Check Repetition:

        Your LinkedIn is listed twice. Just keep it once.

üí° Optional Extras

    Add a Certifications section if you‚Äôve done any relevant ML/Data Science/Cloud certifications.

    If you've done other projects or hackathons, briefly include them (can help stand out).

TL;DR:

Very solid foundation ‚Äî with a few formatting tweaks, some clearer skills organization, and added metrics to your ML project, you‚Äôll have a highly competitive CV for junior ML engineer roles.
